## Welcome to my Github



If you don't know what is git or github, you can go to this website to search: [search](https://www.baidu.com/)



Here is the my another md file:[test.md](./test.md)



First I want to show you one video-game character that I like:

![Arthur](.\Arthur.png"亚瑟·摩根")



Then, the person below is one I dislike in the same game: 

![Micah Bell](https://img.3dmgame.com/uploads/images/news/20191105/1572941465_538449.jpg"迈卡·贝尔")



Which one of them do you like?

```python
def output(string):
    print("I like "+string+" instead of the other one.")
```



Here is one sentence Arthur often says:

> Revenge is a fool's game.	(复仇是蠢人的游戏)



Here are some other characters in the game:

* Dutch van der Linde
* **Charles Smith**
* **Sadie Adler**
* ***John Marston***



Here are some things you can do in the game:

1. Fishing
2. Gambling
3. Boating
4. Swimming
5. Robbing Bank
6. Riding horses
7. Hunting
8. ...



There are two characters players can control:

|     Name      |                 Duration                 |
| :-----------: | :--------------------------------------: |
| Arthur Morgan | Chapter 1 ~ First half part of Chapter 6 |
| John Marston  |         The ending of Chapter 6          |

​	Sadly, the reason that we can control two characters is that the first character ~~'Arthur Morgan' died of pneumonia.~~

### Ending

​	The game's name is 'Red Dead Redemption 2'. I highly recommend you to play this game.
